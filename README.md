## Class
 It is a blueprint or a template to create javascript objects with predefined properities and methods and it was developed in ECMA script 2015.

<br>

## Components of class
### Constructor
It is a special method for creating and initialising objects created with class.

``` bash
class ClassName {
constructor() {...};
}
```
<br>

### Instance
For the given class name and constructor method ,if we initialize the new objects with different arguments,those new objects are called as the instances of the given class.

<br>

### Instance method
It is a method (function call) which calls on the instances of a class.

<br>

### Static
It is a class method(function call) which calls on the class itself.It cannot be used as a function call on instances of a class.Static is used to create utility functions for applications.
<br>

## Rules to follow
* Class name should begin with Uppercase.
* If static method is used,the name should begin with Uppercase.
* It has to have the exact name "constructor".
